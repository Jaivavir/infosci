Q 1. What did we do
Ans 1. We were introduced to our instructor for the second module, Doctor Pinzon. 
We watched a multimedia presentation describing the basics of computational thinking.
We experienced the difficulties of true computational thinking first-hand by attempting to make a sandwich.
We were introduced to github and created our information science journal entry.

Q 2. What did I learn
Ans 2. I learned the 4 steps of computational thinking; Decomposition, Pattern Recognition, Abstraction, Algorithym Design.
I learned that ture computational thinking leaves no room for assumptions. 
I learned that Doctor Pinzon has a subtle sense of humour.

Q 3. What questions do I have
Ans 3. How will we be using computational thinking throughout this module? 
How will be be translating this information into real world application?
What will be be learning next lesson?
